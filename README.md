This is a coding assignment

## Known issues

### Formatting

- `ShowDetail` page overflow, spacing, and wrapping between widths of 576px and 768px
- Some show's details are shifted left in `ShowListItem` on XL (wider than 1190px) screens. This seems to occur with the summaries are short in length. Search for the show, `Blue`, for an example.

### To Dos

- Add clear button and search icon on search input
- Add global error handling with user feedback
- Add placeholder graphics for images when loading
- Get rating per epidode, rather than for the entire show
- Make the season picker work with native mobile controls
- Pagination on pages with long lists of search results
- Show animation when selecting seasons / updating episodes from API
